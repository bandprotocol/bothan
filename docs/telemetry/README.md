# Telemetry

To provide better visibility into the status and activity of the system, Bothan includes a built-in telemetry service powered by the OpenTelemetry framework. Metrics are exposed over HTTP, making them easy to integrate with Prometheus for monitoring and observability.

---
## Configuration
The telemetry service is not active by default, and must be enabled in Bothan's configuration:

```toml
[telemetry]
enabled = false
addr = "127.0.0.1:4318"
```

## Metrics Overview

### 1. gRPC Server Request Metrics

Used to track incoming requests that call each function.

#### Metrics
| Name                                 | Type      | Description                                      |
|--------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `server_requests`                    | `u64` Counter   | Total number of requests sent to the server           |
| `server_request_duration_milliseconds` | `u64` Histogram | Time taken to process each request (ms)     |

#### Tags
- `service_name`: `get_info`, `update_registry`, `push_monitoring_records`, `get_prices`
- `status`: gRPC response code, e.g., `ok`, `unavailable`, etc.

### 2. REST Polling Metrics

Used in workers that poll REST APIs to retrieve asset info.

#### Metrics
| Name                              | Type      | Description                                                           |
|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `rest_polling`                    | `u64` Counter   | Total number of polling requests sent by the worker to the source
| `rest_polling_duration_milliseconds` | `u64` Histogram | Time taken by the worker to complete each polling request to fetch asset info (in milliseconds)                    |

#### Tags
- `status`: `success`, `failed`, `timeout`

---

### 3. WebSocket Polling Metrics

Used by workers that establish WebSocket connections to each source: Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, HTX, Kraken, and OKX.

#### Metrics
| Name                                     | Type      | Description                                                                |
|------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `websocket_activity_messages`            | `u64` Counter   | Total number of messages sent by the source to indicate whether the source is active or not  |
| `websocket_connection_duration_milliseconds` | `u64` Histogram | Time taken for worker to establish a websocket connection to the source (ms)                              |
| `websocket_connection`                  | `u64` Counter   | Total number of connections established by a worker to the source                              |

#### Tags
- `worker`: identifier for the worker instance
- `message_type`: `asset_info` or `ping`
- `status`: `"success"` or `failed`

---
## Integration with Prometheus
With `enabled = true` set for telemetry in your config.toml, the telemetry service will be activated and will expose metrics using the Prometheus encoder over HTTP at `http://localhost:4318/metrics`.

After starting Bothan with `bothan start`, and once the worker has been built and is receiving incoming gRPC requests, open `http://localhost:4318/metrics` in your browser â€” you should see the Prometheus-formatted metrics.

## Grafana Dashboard
Grafana provides a Bothan Dashboard template to visualize metrics efficiently. You can download and import the dashboard from Grafana's official repository.
