A high-performance cryptocurrency price data aggregation system built in Rust.

## Overview

Bothan is a collection of libraries for querying and interacting with various cryptocurrency price data APIs. It provides a unified interface for accessing real-time and historical cryptocurrency price data from multiple exchanges and data providers.

## Project Structure

This project comprises primarily of 6 main components:

- [`bothan-core`](bothan-core/) - Core functionality and shared types
- [`bothan-lib`](bothan-lib/) - Common utilities and shared code
- [`bothan-api`](bothan-api/) - Main API server implementation
- [`bothan-api-proxy`](bothan-api-proxy/) - API proxy for load balancing and caching
- [`bothan-{exchange}`](bothan-binance/) - Exchange-specific implementations
- [`proto`](proto/) - Protocol buffer definitions

## Supported Data Sources

- [Binance](bothan-binance)
- [Bybit](bothan-bybit)
